## Getting Started

To get the Financial Tracker service up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the Financial Tracker repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/telsangvi/financial-tracker.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:cd financial-tracker
3. Install dependencies:npm install

## Starting the Service
1. Run docker compose up -d : The service will be accessible at http://localhost:3000

# Docker Compose Configuration
The `docker-compose.yml`configuration sets up three services:

## MongoDB Service (`db`)

- A MongoDB container named `db` is created based on the `mongo:latest` image.
- Environment variables are set for initializing the root username, password, and the initial database named `FinancialTracker`.
- MongoDB data is stored in the local `./.mongodb` directory on the host machine, mapped to the `/data/db` directory inside the container.
- The MongoDB service is accessible on the host machine at port `27017`.
- Part of the `network-development` Docker network.

## Mongo Express Service (`mongo-express`)

- A Mongo Express container named `mongo_express` is created based on the `mongo-express` image.
- Depends on the `db` service, waiting for it to be ready before starting.
- Environment variables configure access to the MongoDB instance.
- The web-based Mongo Express interface is accessible on the host machine at port `8081`.
- Part of the `network-development` Docker network.

## Financial Tracker Application (`financial-tracker`)

- A custom financial-tracker container named `financial-tracker` is created based on a custom image tagged as `financial-tracker:1.0.0`.
- Built using the `./Dockerfile` from the current context (`.`).
- Environment variables are loaded from the `.env` file.
- The application's source code is mounted from the host machine at the current directory to `/usr/financial-tracker` inside the container.
- Node modules are mounted separately to avoid conflicts between host and container.
- The application is accessible on the host machine at port `3000`.
- Port `9229` is exposed for potential debugging.
- Part of the `network-development` Docker network.

## Networks

- A Docker network named `network-development` is created as a bridge network.

To start the services, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

# Configuring WSL for Docker on Windows

If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run Docker on your Windows machine, follow these steps for setup:

## Prerequisites

Before configuring WSL for Docker, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## Steps

1. **Install Docker Desktop for Windows:**

   Download and install Docker Desktop for Windows from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Enable WSL 2:**

   Open Docker Desktop and go to `Settings -> General`. Check the box for "Use the WSL 2 based engine."

3. **Install WSL:**

   If you haven't already installed WSL, you can follow the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

4. **Set WSL Version for Default Distribution:**

   Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to set WSL version 2 for the default distribution:

   ```bash
   wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2
